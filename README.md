#n-queens
This is a project on the N-Queens algorithm I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). I worked on this project with Dan Snyder.

## Overview

N-Queens is an algorithm to calculate how many different ways n # of queens can fit on an n x n chessboard. Their are multiple ways to calculate the total number. This algorithm uses backtracking and keeping track of the state using recursion.
